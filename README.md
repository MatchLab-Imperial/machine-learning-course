# Machine Learning Course Labs

Welcome! Here we will upload the different tutorials for the Machine Learning course. 
We will use Python and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Also, the tutorials use [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. 

Each of the notebooks contains this image

which when clicked takes you to the Colaboratory website. 

Colaboratory provides cloud computing, so you can modify part of the tutorials and retrain the models to test your modifications. 

We will update the repository during the course with new tutorials.

## Links to the notebooks
Sometimes the notebooks do not render correctly in GitHub. You can access directly the notebook in the Colab environment using the following links.
